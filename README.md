# NSA Product Generator

*[Click here to see the Product Generator in action!](https://ternus.github.io/nsaproductgenerator/)*

Inspired by the leak of NSA's TAO product catalog. "I Can't Believe It's Not Classified" -- contains 0% top-secret verbiage.

If you're looking to modify the code, the word lists and (more or less) Mad Lib engine are all in nsa.js, which uses Handlebars.js to do templating.

Have fun!
